both documenting the requirements and creating a prototype. Here's how I can break this down:

1. Requirements Documentation
Chit Fund Management System Requirements

Core Features
Member Registration and Management

Registration for new members with essential personal and financial details.
Track member details like name, contact info, address, and fund preferences.
Admin or Agent should be able to update and manage member details.
Track the number of members in each chit group.
Chit Fund Payment and Bonus Structure

Core Payment Logic:
Member contributes to a chit fund for a specific duration (e.g., 20 months).
Each member receives a fixed monthly bonus once the chit fund is successful.
Agent/Admin Commission (variable between ₹3,000–₹5,000) is subtracted from the payout.
Bonus Calculation:
Calculate the bonus for each member monthly.
Bonus is based on total amount, duration of payment, and commission.
Early Payout Adjustments:
If a member opts for early payouts, adjust the bonus and admin fee accordingly.
Example case: Member Sharath pays ₹5,000 for 10 months and ₹50,000 for 11th month, getting ₹1.05 lakh after commission.
Financial Transaction Tracking

Track individual member payments for each month.
Record and monitor any adjustments or changes in payments.
Admin and Agent can see both contributions and payouts.
Ensure the system adjusts for early or delayed payments and calculates dues accordingly.
Reporting

Generate monthly/annual financial statements for each member and chit fund.
Include reports such as: total funds collected, member payouts, bonus distributed, admin commission.
Track individual member's status on funds, bonus, and payments.
Communication Tools Integration

Integrate communication methods (SMS/Email/WhatsApp) to notify members and agents about payments, reminders, and updates.
Use tools like Twilio for messaging services to integrate SMS and WhatsApp features.

Database Integration:

PostgreSQL: Use PostgreSQL for secure and efficient database management.
Transaction Tracking: Ensure every payment, contribution, and adjustment is recorded.
Data Security: Ensure encrypted data storage and secure access to sensitive information.
2. Prototype Creation
Since I don't have direct access to Adobe XD or other design tools at the moment, I can guide you through creating the prototype, or I can create a textual flow and layout idea for the application, and you could either use that as a base for the prototype or I can help create one in other tools.
